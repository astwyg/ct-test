# what is this?

This is RESTful API testbench using in ctyun.

# how to write testcases?

See cases folder, just follow the existed cases. All tools are very easy to use.

# how to use?

1. make sure you have python 2.7 installed.
2. `pip install -r requirments.txt`
3. run a testcase in folder **cases**, using an IDE such as pyCharm will make it better.

# TIPS

tools.request.post/get is fully compatible with ct-fcore, so you can just copy your api definitions from project **biz_portal** to test cases.
